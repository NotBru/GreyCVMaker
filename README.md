# GreyCVMaker
Very simple script to make a minimalistic CV.

A nice generalization of this would be a grid-oriented thing, but this serves just fine for me to eventually update my CV and have it look about the same. Lots of things to improve (say, automatically wrap text and stuff), but I have no need for it.
